# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on determining the number of employees that are reaching the stage of retirement. We will be using pgAdmin, SQL to perform the total retiring employees by title. Moreover, this project will identify those who are eligible to participate in a mentorship programs.

## Results
- The retirement titles table presents all the retiring employees whose birthday falls between 1952 and 1955. Table 1 also shows the title, from date and to date of each employee. As shown, there are duplicate entries in the table because we havenâ€™t filtered the table for the most current position.

<br> Table 1: retirement titles

- The unique titles table uses DISTINCT ON statement to retrieve the first occurrence employee number, and it sorts the table in ascending order by the employee number and depending order by the to_date. As table 2 shown, there is no duplicate entry for some employees, and the title has been updated to the most current position.

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
